# Want to try bgit?

bgit is **still in development** and doesn't yet offer full parity with the Git ecosystem, so it's not quite ready for general public use. However, if you're interested in giving it a try, follow these steps:

1. **Install bgit**:

   Run the following command to install bgit:

   ```bash
   cargo install --locked bgit
   ```

2. **Invoke bgit**:

   After installation, run:

   ```bash
   bgit
   ```

3. **Clone a project**:

   When bgit prompts you to either "init" or "clone", choose **clone**. Then paste the following repository URL:

   ```
   https://github.com/rootCircle/bgit_clone_sample
   ```

   Press **Enter**, and watch bgit automatically set up the project for you!
